An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for **Microsoft OneNote**. Bring your notebooks into Claude, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible client — list notebooks and sections, full-text search across pages, read individual pages, and create or delete pages from natural language. Authentication uses Microsoft's device-code flow against your own Entra ID app registration, so your data and credentials never leave your machine.

## Quick start

### 1. Register a Microsoft Entra app

The server talks to Microsoft Graph using a Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) **app registration** that you own. This takes about 2 minutes.

> Screenshots referenced below live in [`docs/images/`](docs/images/). They are placeholders today — contributions welcome.

#### a. Create the registration

1. Go to the [Microsoft Entra admin center → App registrations](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) and click **+ New registration**.
2. **Name**: anything (e.g. `onenote-mcp`).
3. **Supported account types**: choose **"Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts"** if you want both work and personal OneNote to work; otherwise pick what matches your tenant.
4. **Redirect URI**: leave blank — the device-code flow doesn't need one.
5. Click **Register**.

#### b. Add the API permissions

1. In the new app's left nav, click **API permissions** → **+ Add a permission** → **Microsoft Graph** → **Delegated permissions**.
2. Search for and check both:
   - `Notes.ReadWrite`
   - `offline_access`
3. Click **Add permissions**. (No admin consent is required for personal Microsoft accounts. Work/school tenants may need an admin to grant consent for the directory.)

   ![Add Notes.ReadWrite + offline_access](docs/images/02-permissions.png)

#### c. Allow the public client flow

The device-code flow is a "public client" flow — it doesn't use a client secret.

1. Go to **Authentication** in the left nav.
2. Scroll to **Advanced settings** → **Allow public client flows** and toggle it **Yes**.
3. Click **Save**.

#### d. Grab the client ID

Back on the app's **Overview** page, copy the **Application (client) ID**. You'll pass it to the server via the `ONENOTE_MCP_CLIENT_ID` environment variable.

  ![Application (client) ID on the Overview page](docs/images/04-client-id.png)

### 2. Sign in

```sh
ONENOTE_MCP_CLIENT_ID=<your-app-client-id> npx @atomiclabs/onenote-mcp login
```

This prints a code and a URL like:

```
To sign in, use a web browser to open https://microsoft.com/devicelogin
and enter the code ABCD-1234 to authenticate.
```

Open the URL, paste the code, sign in with the Microsoft account whose OneNote you want to access, and approve the requested permissions. The refresh token is then cached at `~/.config/onenote-mcp/tokens.json` (mode `600`) so the MCP server can run silently.

To sign out:

```sh
npx @atomiclabs/onenote-mcp logout
```

### 3. Wire it into your MCP client

#### Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "onenote": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@atomiclabs/onenote-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ONENOTE_MCP_CLIENT_ID": "your-app-client-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. The OneNote tools should appear in the tool picker.

#### Cursor

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "onenote": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@atomiclabs/onenote-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ONENOTE_MCP_CLIENT_ID": "your-app-client-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Anything else

Any MCP-compatible client that supports stdio servers will work. Run `npx @atomiclabs/onenote-mcp` with `ONENOTE_MCP_CLIENT_ID` set in the environment.

## Known limitations

- **Attachments are sent in-memory.** `create_page` reads attachment files synchronously before posting; very large files (~150 MB+) may strain Node's heap. Streamed uploads are a future enhancement.
- **`update_page` targets are raw `data-id` selectors.** To edit a specific element, read the page first and pull the `data-id` attribute out of the returned HTML. Higher-level selectors (e.g. "the section under heading X") are tracked for a follow-up.
- **Search latency.** Microsoft Graph's `$search` against `/me/onenote/pages` can take a few seconds against large notebooks; the server retries on 429s with exponential backoff.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. The codebase aims to stay small and focused.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ahmadAlMezaal/onenote-mcp
cd onenote-mcp
yarn install
yarn build
yarn test
```

- `yarn typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit` (covers `src/` + `scripts/`)
- `yarn lint` — ESLint
- `yarn test` — Vitest (unit tests, mocked Graph)
- `yarn dev` — incremental rebuild on save (`tsc --watch` + `tsc-alias --watch`); `dist/` stays runnable

> Use Yarn (Classic), not npm. The repo's lockfile is `yarn.lock` — `package-lock.json` should not be committed.

### End-to-end smoke test

`scripts/smoke.ts` exercises every shipped tool against a real OneNote account. It's not in CI — needs real credentials.

```sh
# One-time: register an Entra app (see Quick start above) and sign in
ONENOTE_MCP_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id> yarn build
ONENOTE_MCP_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id> node dist/cli.js login

# Then run the smoke test
ONENOTE_MCP_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id> yarn smoke
```

It's idempotent: reuses (or creates) a notebook called **OneNote MCP Smoke Test**, walks through 12 steps covering auth, list/search/read/create/update/delete and the multipart attachment path, and cleans up the pages it creates. Sections and section groups are left behind for the next run.

If you're using an AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), see [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for project conventions, the arrow-function rule, and the tool-authoring checklist.

Commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.). CI runs typecheck + lint + tests on every push and PR.

### Roadmap

- [x] `update_page` — in-place edits via Graph's `PATCH` syntax
- [x] `create_section` / `create_notebook`
- [x] Image and attachment upload (multipart create_page)
- [x] Section group support (list + create + section-in-group targeting)
- [ ] Streamed attachment uploads (avoid in-memory buffering for large files)
- [ ] Resource-style page browsing (alongside the tool surface)
